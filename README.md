# CIS1050-NYC-Restaurant-Health-Inspection
CIS 1050 final project
In this project, I explored four hypothesis to analyze the health inspection data from NYC restaurants. THe first hypothesis investigated the inspection scores of Staten Isalnd restaurants and plotted those against other boroughs, revealing Staten Island had significantly lower scores with a p-value of 0.0. The second hypothesis compared the distribution of cuisines between the Bronx and Manhattan, using total variation distance (TVD) to confirm that these boroughs have distinctly different restaurant cuisines (p < 0.001). In the third hypothesis, we explored whether coffee/tea or pizza restaurants exhibited more critical health inspection results. The difference in critical inspection ratio was statistically significant (p < 0.001), indicating a preference for one cuisine type. Lastly, I constructed a regression model to predict health inspection scores based on cuisine type, finding that certain cuisines correlated significantly with high or lower inspection scores (p < 0.04). Together, these analyses demonstrate significant borough-based differences and cuisine-type correlations in health inspection results, helping guide food safety improvements across New York City.
